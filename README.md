# Predicting-Future-Movements-from-Skeleton-Data
This notebook tackles predicting future movements from skeleton data, crucial for applications like fall detection or gesture recognition. Leveraging deep learning, it preprocesses the dataset, trains a CNN model, evaluates its accuracy, and generates predictions for submission, all in a structured manner.
